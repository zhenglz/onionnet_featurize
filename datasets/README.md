# Featurization of PDBbind v2018 based on OnionNet version 1
## Command used:
  
    python gen_features.py -inp input_testv2016_onnetv1

    # then for each target (one pdb code), a csv output file 
    # will be generated in its corresponding folder as stated in
    # input_testv2016_onnetv1 column #3

## All related features pre-generated: onnetv1_features.tgz
Untar the file, and you will have 3 csv files for train (11883), validate(996) and test (290). Related labels could also be found in this folder. All the features are generated with "-mode mdtraj".

Please be careful, the labels for training contains only 11881 samples, there are two mismatches with the train feature file. This will be fixed soon.
